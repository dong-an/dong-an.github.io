My name is Dong An (安冬). I am an Assistant Professor at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/) (BICMR), Peking University. 

I worked as a Hartree Postdoctoral Fellow at [Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science](https://quics.umd.edu) (QuICS), University of Maryland, in 2021-2024. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from University of California, Berkeley in 2021, advised by Professor [Lin Lin](https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/), and my B.S. degree in computational mathematics from Peking University in 2016. 

My research interest is **Quantum** X **Applied Mathematics**, which is primarily twofold: Quantum algorithms for classical scientific computing problems, and classical algorithms for quantum many-body problems. 

Currently I mainly work on exploring power and limitations of quantum algorithms for scientific computing tasks, including large-scale linear systems of equations, ordinary or partial differential equations, Hamiltonian simulation, stochastic differential equations, and optimal control. I’m also interested in adiabatic quantum computing and variational quantum algorithms, especially their theoretical analysis.
