My name is Dong An (安冬). I am currently a Hartree Postdoctoral Fellow at [Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science](https://quics.umd.edu), University of Maryland, since September 2021. 

I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from University of California, Berkeley in 2021, advised by [Lin Lin](https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/), and my B.S. degree in computational mathematics from Peking University in 2016.
